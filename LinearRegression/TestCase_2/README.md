# Simple-Linear-Regression - Weather-dataset

The Test Case is to predict the max temperature by training the model with the given min and max temp data.

Here is the code to learn and implement the linear regression using the weather dataset and to predict 

A simple python program that implements Linear Regression on a sample dataset. The program works with sklearn.linear_model from the scikit-learn library to import the class LinearRegression.
